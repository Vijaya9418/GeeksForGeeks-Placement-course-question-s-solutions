Given an integer n. Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number.
The nth Fibonacci number is given by the forumla F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). The first few fibonacci numbers are:
1 1 2 3 5... and so on.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output: 
3
Explanation:
In the series 1 1 2 3 5...... the fourth
fibonacci number is 3.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 6
Output: 
8
Explanation:
In the series 1 1 2 3 5 8 13...... the
sixth fibonacci number is 8.


Solution:-

public static int fibonacci(int n){
    
   if(n<=1)
   {
       return n;
   }
   return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2);
        
    //Write your code here to calculate
    //to calculate the nth fibonacci number
        
}
