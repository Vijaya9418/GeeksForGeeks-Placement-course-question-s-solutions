Given an array arr[] of size N containing positive integers and an integer X, find the element in the array which is smaller than X and closest to it.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 67 13 12 15}
X = 16
Output: 15
Explanation: For a given value 16, there
are four values which are smaller than
it. But 15 is the number which is smaller
and closest to it with minimum difference
of 1.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1 2 3 4 5}
X = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: No value is smaller than 1.


Solution:-

class Solution
{
    // Complete the function
    public static int immediateSmaller(int arr[], int n, int x)
    {
       int smaller=-1;
       
       for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
       {
           if(arr[i]<x &&arr[i]>smaller)
           {
               smaller=arr[i];
           }
       }
       return smaller;
    }
}
