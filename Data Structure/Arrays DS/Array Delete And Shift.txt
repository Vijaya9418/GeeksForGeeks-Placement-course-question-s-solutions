You are given an array arr(0-based indexing). The size of the array is given by n. You need to delete an element at given index and print the modified array. The arr[i] of array is initially set to i+1.
Deletion means you need to shift all the elements after that index to the left by 1 position and set the last element as zero.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
index = 0
Output: 2 3 4 5 0
Example 2:

Input:
n = 6
index = 3
Output: 1 2 3 5 6 0


Solution:-


class Solution
{
    // Complete the function
    public static void deleteFromArray(int arr[], int n, int index)
    {
     for(int i=index; i<n-1; i++)
     {
         arr[i]=arr[i+1];
     }
     arr[n-1]=0;
    }
    
    
}
