You are given two numbers n and p. You need to find np.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 9 p = 9 
Output: 3874204899
Explanation: 387420489 is the value 
obtained when 9 is raised to the 
power of 9.

Example 2:

Input:
n = 2 p = 9
Output: 512
Explanation: 512 is the value 
obtained when 2 is raised to 
the power of 9.  


Solution:-

class Solution
{
    static int RecursivePower(int n,int p)
    {
      if(p == 0)
{
return 1;
}
return n*RecursivePower(n,p-1);
    }
 
}
