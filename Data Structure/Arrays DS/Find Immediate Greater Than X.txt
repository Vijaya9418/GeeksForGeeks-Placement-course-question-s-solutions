Given an array arr[] of size N containing positive integers and an integer X. You need to find the value in the array which is greater than X and closest to it. ( if no such value exists the answer should be -1)

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 67 13 12 15}
X = 16
Output: 67
Explanation: For a given value 16, there
is only one value 67 that greater than
it and so it is the answer.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1 2 3 4 5}
X = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: For a given value 1, there
are 4 values greater than it 2 3 4 5.
But 2 is closest to 1 so it is the answer

class Solution
{
    // Complete the function
    public static int immediateGreater(int arr[], int n, int x)
    {
      int large=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
       
       for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
       {
           if(arr[i]>x &&arr[i]<large)
           {
               large=arr[i];
           }
       }
       if(large==Integer.MAX_VALUE)
       {
       return -1;
       }
       
       return large;
    }
    
    
}
