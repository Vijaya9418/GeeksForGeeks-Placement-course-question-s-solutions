Given the first 2 terms A and B of a Geometric Series. The task is to find the Nth term of the series.

Example 1:

Input:
A = 2 
B = 3
N = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The first term is already
given in the input as 2
Example 2:

Input:
A = 1
B = 2
N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Common ratio = 2,
Hence second term is 2.

Solution:-

class Solution
{
    
    public double termOfGP(int A,int B,int N)
    {
       double r=(double)B/(double)A;
       return A*(Math.pow(r,N-1));
       
    }

}
