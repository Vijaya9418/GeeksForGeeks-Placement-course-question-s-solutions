Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a.
Example 1:

Input:
a = 1
b = 2
Output: 
2 1
Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2,
now a = 2 and b = 1.
Example 2:

Input:
a = 6 
b = 7 
Output: 7 6 
Explanation: Initially a = 6 and b = 7,
now a = 7 and b = 6.

Solution:-

class Solution
{
    public void utility(int a, int b){
        int temp;
        temp=a;
        a=b;
        b=temp;
        
        
        System.out.println(a+" "+b);
    }
}
