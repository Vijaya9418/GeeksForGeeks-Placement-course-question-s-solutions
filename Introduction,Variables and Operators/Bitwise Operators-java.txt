Bitwise operators are useful when we want to work with bits. Here, we'll take a look at them.

Given three positive integers a, b and c. Your task is to perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
1. d = a ^ a
2. e = c ^ b
3. f = a & b
4. g = c | (a ^ a)
5. e = ~e
Note: ^ is for xor.

Example 1:

Input:
4 8 2

Output:
0
10
0
2
-11
Example 2:

Input:
7 7 7

Output:
0
0
7
7
-1


Solution:-

class Geeks{
    static void bitWiseOp(int a, int b, int c){
        int d=a^a;
        int e = c ^ b;
 int f = a & b;
 int g = c | (a ^ a);
 int h = ~e;
 
 System.out.println(d);
 System.out.println(e);
 System.out.println(f);
 System.out.println(g);
 System.out.println(h);
        // Your code here
        
    }
}
