You are given an array numbers that contains integers. You need to return the floor value of average of the non negative integers.

Note: floor returns the nearest mathematical integer value that is less than or equal to the argument.

Example 1:

Input:
numbers = [-12, 8, -7, 6, 12, -9, 14]
Output:
avg = 10
Explanation: The positive numbers are
8 6 12 14.
The sum is 8+6+12+14 = 40,
Average = 40/4 = 10

Example 2:

Input:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
Output:
avg = 2
Explanation: The positive numbers are
1 2 3.
The sum is 1+2+3 = 6, Average = 6/3 = 2


Solution:-

class Solution
{
    int posAverage(int numbers[], int size)
    {
      
       int sum=0;
       int count=0;
       
       for(int i=0; i<numbers.length; i++)
       {
            if(numbers[i]>=0)
            {
           count++;
           sum+=numbers[i];
           
            }
           
       }
        
       
       return sum/count;
       
    }
}
