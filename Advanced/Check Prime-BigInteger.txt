Given an integer n check if n is prime or not.
A prime number is a number that is divisible by 1 and itself only.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 17
Output: 
True
Explanation:
17 is  divisible by  only 1 and 17.
So it's a prime number.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 56
Output: 
False
Explanation:
56 is divisible by 2, 4, 7.....etc. So
its not a prime number.

Solution:-
public static boolean prime(int n){
    
  String b=String.valueOf(n);
  
  BigInteger a=new BigInteger(b);
  return a.isProbablePrime(100);
    
    
}
